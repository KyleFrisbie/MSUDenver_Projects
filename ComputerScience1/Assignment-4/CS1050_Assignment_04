Specification

This program uses files for input and output and is based on the File Input/Output Example handout.

The names of the input and output files should be:
		YourName_S_04_Input.txt
		YourName_S_04_Output.txt

You will need to create an input file which contains at least 10 numbers. At least two input lines should have more than one number on the same line. Your data should include at least three integers and at least seven real numbers (a real number contains a decimal point; include digits other than zero after the decimal point, like 87.65) An example of an input file is:

	1   2.3    4.56
	7    8.901
	12
	4.55       6.78
	9.99
	10.10

You will need to insert code that averages the numbers that are read from the input file. To do so, you’ll need to count the number of numbers and keep a running total. Output the individual number read and the running total sum to the output file and to the console. After reading all the numbers, output the following to the screen with appropriate messages:


1.	The total number of numbers read.
2.	The sum of the numbers read.
3.	The average of the numbers.

Be sure to include comments in the header area at the start of the program and that the revision numbers, if any, are noted.

Please staple the sheets and write the usual information at the upper right-hand corner of the page.
