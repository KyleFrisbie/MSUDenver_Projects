This program takes an input .txt file with multiple values for miles 
driven. The program analyzes the mileage values from the input file 
and stores them in an array called mileage. The program then 
calculates the appropriate reimbursement for each distance traveled 
based on values provided for in the spec, and stores them in another 
array (parallel to the mileage array) called reimb. While the program 
is assessing the values, it is printing a table containing the mileage 
value along with its associated reimbursement amount within a new 
output file. Averages of all reimbursement values as well as all 
mileage values will be also be calculated. After the program has 
concluded assessing and printing mileage values and reimbursement 
values, it prints a summary of total reimbursement, the number of 
mileage values processed, the total of the mileage values > 0, and the 
number of positive mileage values.
